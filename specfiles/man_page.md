PAL(1) General Commands Manual PAL(1)

NAME  
pal \-- Your personal AI-powered CLI assistant  
SYNOPSIS  
pal \<command\> \[arguments...\]  
DESCRIPTION  
pal is a command-line utility that uses AI to help you accomplish  
tasks. It can generate scripts, execute commands based on natural  
language prompts, and manage a library of reusable scripts.  
 Interaction with \*\*pal\*\* is divided into several commands:

\*\*chat\*\* Initiate a conversation with pal to generate commands.  
 \*\*exec\*\* Execute a pre-existing or temporary pal script.  
 \*\*save\*\* Saves a script or command for future use.  
 \*\*help\*\* Display the help message.

COMMANDS  
help  
Displays the main help message, listing all available commands  
and their basic usage.  
 \*\*chat\*\* \[prompt\]  
 Engages with the pal AI.

         Running \`pal chat\` without a prompt enters an interactive
         session.

         Providing a \[prompt\] will cause \*\*pal\*\* to generate a script or
         command to accomplish the task. It will then ask for
         confirmation before executing.

         \*\*--vibe\*\*
                 When used with a prompt (e.g., \`pal chat \--vibe \<prompt\>\`),
                 \*\*pal\*\* will generate and immediately execute the command
                 or script without asking for confirmation. The AI will
                 decide if a simple command or a full script is needed.

\*\*exec\*\* \<script_name\> \[prompt\]  
 Executes a \*\*pal\*\* script.

         If a \[prompt\] is provided for a script that takes parameters,
         \*\*pal\*\* will use the prompt to determine the correct parameter
         values and ask for confirmation.

         If a \[prompt\] is provided but the script does not take parameters,
         \*\*pal\*\* will suggest a modification to the script based on the
         prompt.

         \*\*--temp\*\*
                 Executes a script from the temporary directory. After
                 execution, \*\*pal\*\* will suggest saving the script with
                 the \`save\` command.

         \*\*--param\*\* '\<key\>=\<value\>'
                 Executes a script with an explicit parameter.

\*\*save\*\* \<script_name\> \[--last\]  
 Saves a script or command to your permanent \*\*pal\*\* command  
 library.

         If a command with the same name already exists, you will be
         prompted to confirm the overwrite.

         \*\*--last\*\*
                 Saves the last command executed by \*\*pal\*\* as a new
                 script with the given \<script\_name\>.

EXAMPLES  
\* Get help:  
$ pal help  
 \* Ask \*\*pal\*\* to create a commit message (generates a temp script):  
 \`$ pal chat create a commit message based on my diff\`

\* Use \*\*vibe\*\* mode to execute a simple command immediately:  
 \`$ pal chat \--vibe find all .img files recursively\`  
 \` \`find . \-type f \-name "\*.img"\`  
 \` ./smile.img\`  
 \` ./pal.img\`

\* Save the last executed command as a reusable script:  
 \`$ pal save find \--last\`  
 \`Saved the last executed command to \~/.pal/command/find\`

\* Ask \*\*pal\*\* to update a script to make it configurable:  
 \`$ pal exec find all .txt and .img files recursively\`  
 \`The find script is not configurable. Would you like me to update the script... (y/n)?\`  
 \`$ y\`  
 \`I've updated your script in \~/.pal/command/tmp/find.sh\`  
 \` \`pal exec \--temp find \--param 'fileType=\[img txt\]'\`\`  
 \`Would you like to execute? (y/n)\`

\* Override an existing saved script:  
 \`$ pal save commit\`  
 \`You are overriding an existing script. Are you sure you want to proceed? (y/n)\`  
 \`$ y\`  
 \`Saved the script to \~/.pal/command/commit.sh\`

FILES  
\~/.pal/command/  
The directory for permanent, user-saved scripts.  
 \~/.pal/command/tmp/  
 The directory for temporary scripts generated by \*\*pal\*\*.  
 Scripts in here are deleted after one week.
